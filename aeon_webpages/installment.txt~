1) Dependencies:
Currently AEON is only tested on linux. Please install all
required software package as below:

gcc/g++:
The GNU C and C++ compilers. Mace is used regularly with GCC versions 4.5 and
4.6. It has been known to work in the past with 3.4 (including MinGW),  4.0,
4.1,  4.2 and 4.3,  and prior to that,  it has in the worked with a few GCC
version 3.3.X systems,  but most frequently causes internal compiler
segmentation faults. Using at least version 3.4 is highly recommended. This
should also be accompanied with a build system that cmake can output builds
for.)

perl:
Perl version 5.8 or greater. Additionally,  Class-MakeMethods and
Parse-RecDescent modules are needed (and are included in mace-extras).

system libraries:
libpthread,  libm,  libcrypto,  libstdc++,  and libssl.

libboost:
Used in a few places for shared pointers and lexical casting. Requires
libboost-test and libboost-filesystem.

libdb_cxx:
Version 4.X. This is the Berkeley DB package,  and is optional for building
Mace.

cmake:
Mace uses the CMake build system for cross-platform building.

OpenSSL:
Cryptography support

lgrind:
For making the documentation from the source files,  beautifying the source
code. Also needs LaTeX.
