Here we introduce how to play the demo of AEON. In this demo, we would like to
show how a game server scale up & down according to the number of active
clients. In this demo, it requires 5 machines.

1) compile:
cd distributed-eventwave/builds/
make mace

make ElasticTagApp

If you encounter errors in this step, please edit file: 
distributed-eventwave/builds/services/ElasticTagApp/CMakeFiles/ElasticTagApp.dir/flags.make

Add "-std=c++0x" after "-Werror", which should be "-Werror -std=c++0x"

make contextrun

2) create client & server folders

on client server:
mkdir ~/AEON/client

on all server machines
mkdir ~/AEON/server

3) configuration file
go to /distributed-eventwave/demo
edit file hosts and put the machines as the following order:
client-machine
server-machine1
server-machine2
server-machine3
server-machine4

./generate-params-files.sh
It will generate required configuration file

4) Pre-demo

Please install pssh


5) run demo
go to /distributed-eventwave/demo
cp ../builds/application/testrun/contextrun

./prepare_execute.sh
./start_servers.sh
./start_clients.sh

6) observing output
The whole execution will last about 25 mins. After 30mins, 
./stop-app.sh

Then you can collect output file (~/AEON/server/output) from all 4 servers.
Then you can obeserve for Room[2] and Room[3] and Room[4],  their output
appears on different output file,  which indicates they migrate among those
servers.
