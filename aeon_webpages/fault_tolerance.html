		<h2>AEON eManager failure</h2>
    <p>eManager is stateless and is only responsible to update context mapping and DAG into cloud storage. 
      Both eManager and cloud storage are assigned a privilege level. eManager could only update DAG and 
      context mapping in cloud storage when its privilege is higher than or equal to storage's privilege level.
    </p>

    <p>Context migration algorithm: to migrate context C from S1 to S2</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Upon receiving migration request, the eManager will compare its privilege level and storage's. 
        If it finds its level is smaller than storage, it ignores the request.</li>
      <li>eManager informs S2 about migration context C and eManager's current privilege level. 
        eManager will wait until receive ack from S2</li>
      <li>eManager informs S1 to migrate C to S2. eManager also sends S1 its privilege level. 
        Upon receiving message from eManager, S1 will holds all messages to C and create a 
        migration event and put it in C's queue;</li>
      <li>The migration event will enter C for execution when all previous events have committed. 
        Then it serializes C and send C to S2 (C is still on S1);</li>
      <li>S2 receives C from S1 and inform eManager the migration is done;</li>
      <li>eManager updates the context mapping in cloud storage and inform S1;</li>
      <li>S1 deletes C and forwards kept messages to S2;</li>
    </ol>
		
    <p>Here we simply assume eManager is placed on a separate server. 
      And S1 and S2 never fail during migration.
    </p>	
		
		<p>At the beginning of migration, S1 and S2 will receive the privilege level of current eManager. 
      And for all following messages from eManager, this privilege level will be included in those messages. 
      If S1 and S2 find their kept privilege level is different from messages' privilege level, 
      they just simply ignore those messages.
    </p>

		<p>During migration, both S1 and S2 will periodically check eManager's states. 
      If S1 or S2 detects eManager failed (eManager may fail or is very slow). Then:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>it waits for a certain time and check eManager again. 
        This is to make sure the other server will be also aware of eManager failed.</li>
      <li>it tries to lock eManager via zookeeper;</li>
      <li>it compare received eManager's privilege level and current storage's privilege level. If:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>its received privilege level is the same as storage's privilege level, goes to step 4;</li>
        <li>otherwise, new eManager is already elected. It just updates its eManager privilege level 
          and read the latest context mapping and exists directly.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>it elects a new eManager via zookeeper and assigns new privilege level (must be larger than the old one) 
        to both new eManager and storage; </li>
      <li> it releases the lock on eManager and read the latest context mapping from the storage;</li>
    </ol>
		
    <p>eManager is only responsible for migration. So it doesn't affect the application execution until the
      contexts migration is required. If one worker server doesn't receive response for a certain time, it
      will process eManager failure as steps above.
