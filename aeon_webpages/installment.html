		<h1>AEON Installment</h1>
		
    <h2>1) Dependencies:</h2>
    <p>Currently AEON is only tested on linux. Please install all required software package as below:</p>

		<h3>gcc/g++:</h3>
		<p>The GNU C and C++ compilers. AEON is used regularly with GCC versions 4.5 and
      4.6. It has been known to work in the past with 3.4 (including MinGW),  4.0,
      4.1,  4.2 and 4.3,  and prior to that,  it has in the worked with a few GCC
      version 3.3.X systems,  but most frequently causes internal compiler
      segmentation faults. Using at least version 3.4 is highly recommended. This
      should also be accompanied with a build system that cmake can output builds for.)
    </p>	
		
		<h3>perl:</h3>
		<p>Perl version 5.8 or greater. Additionally,  Class-MakeMethods and Parse-RecDescent modules are needed (and are included in mace-extras).</p>

		<h3>system libraries:</h3>
		<p>libpthread,  libm,  libcrypto,  libstdc++,  and libssl.</p>
		
    <h3>libboost:</h3>
		<p>Used in a few places for shared pointers and lexical casting. Requires libboost-test and libboost-filesystem.</p>

		<h3>libdb_cxx:</h3>
    <p>Version 4.X. This is the Berkeley DB package,  and is optional for building AEON.</p>

    <h3>cmake:</h3>
  	<p>AEON uses the CMake build system for cross-platform building.</p>

  	<h3>OpenSSL:</h3>
  	<p>Cryptography support.</p>

  	<h3>Python:</h3>
  	<p>Python 2.7 or later version.</p>

  	<h2>2) Getting AEON source codes:</h2>
    <p>hg clone https://bsang@bitbucket.org/bsang/distributed-eventwave</p>

    <h2>3) Compile:</h2>
    <p>cp distributed-eventwave/demo/Serv-CMakeLists.txt distributed-eventwave/services/CMakeLists.txt</p>
    <p>cp distributed-eventwave/demo/App-CMakeLists.txt distributed-eventwave/applications/testrun/CMakeLists.txt</p>
    <p>cd distributed-eventwave/builds/</p>
    <p>cmake ../</p>
